# Process-Injection

Process injection is a technique used by malware to stealthily run its code within a legitimate process already active on a system. Instead of creating new processes, malware injects its code into existing ones, making detection difficult. It's achieved through methods like DLL injection, code injection, or thread injection. Process injection helps malware stay undetected, ensures persistence, and facilitates privilege escalation. Detection is challenging, but strategies like application whitelisting, memory protection, and behavioral monitoring can mitigate risks. Understanding and countering process injection is crucial for effective cybersecurity.
